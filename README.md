# ShorTIER... Get it? ðŸ˜…

Shortier is a basic URL shortener API that shortens your URLs and is tracking the visits of the generated ones.

The project is written with **TypeScript** and can be deployed with `docker-compose` along with **MySQL** database 
where the generated URLs (_shorten_urls_ table) and analytics (_visits_ table) are stored.

### Usage

> **Note:** in order to have the full production experience as if visiting a real URL Shortener domain you need to edit you `hosts` file.

### Getting Started

### Application Structure

The codebase is located under the `/src` directory:

    â”œâ”€â”€ /controllers    # Handles the business logic for a request.
    â”œâ”€â”€ /models         # Sequalize models (typesctipt-sequalize).
    â”œâ”€â”€ /routes         # Maps logic from controllers to a route. 
    â”œâ”€â”€ /services       # Common services and handler functions.
    â”œâ”€â”€ /utils          # Sequalize config & other shared configs.
    â”œâ”€â”€ app.ts          # Setup express to expose routes. 
    â””â”€â”€ server.ts       # Startup server.        

The root directory has all the necessary **NodeJS** files along with `tsconfig.json`, `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` 
and a `Makefile`.

Additional configuration files for **Nodemon** `nodemon.jom`, **ESLint** `.eslintrc` and **Prettier** `.prettierrc` 
can be found in the root directory. Other dev packages configuration:

    }
}
```
